    "* The samples consists of a `sequence` of bases of length `seq_length`. The four possible bases in RNA are A, G, U and C. \n",
    "* RNA molecules have pairings between some of the bases. The estimated pairings are given by `structure`. \n",
    "    * These are however only the pairings determined to be the most likely. Alternative pairings are given by the files in the folder `bpps`, described as the *base pair probabilities* for each base-base pair in the sequence given as an adjacency matrix for each sample.  \n",
    "* `predicted_loop_type` assign a loop type for each base, which describe the for that base in the sequence. For example, a paired base always (this should be confirmed with code) has loop type S for *stem loop* (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stem-loop). Unpaired bases can have a number of different loop types, depending on the structural context of that base (how the molecule is shaped in that part of the sequence).\n",
    "    * \"Predicted\" indicates that these are only estimated loop types for the given sequence, much like how `sequence` is the most likely pairings for the sequence. One could look further into alternative loop types for alternative structures, but in the scope of the project the provided loop type should suffice.\n",
    "\n",
    "Columns which correspond to experimental ground truth values (targets in prediction):\n",
    "* There are 5 \"ground truth\" values to be predicted (targets): `reactivity`, `deg_pH10`, `deg_Mg_pH10`, `deg_50C` and `deg_Mg_50C`. They are arrays of floats, where each value describe the reactivity at a given base. They are ordered in the same way as `sequence` but have length `seq_scored`, which is smaller than `seq_length`, meaning that only the first `seq_scored` bases have ground truth (target) values. This is because the reactivity values of the final bases in the sequence can't be measured experimentally due to technical limitations.\n",
    "* Targets with names `deg_*` describe the likelihood of degradation at the base (my interpretation being the likelihood of the molecule breaking at that node), where `*` specify the conditions for the degradation rates (i.e. at 50 degrees Celcius, or in pH 10). The reactivity values in `reactivity` describe the likely *secondary structure* of the RNA molecule. (\"Secondary structure\" is a technical term, see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleic_acid_secondary_structure). For the purposes of this project, the 5 target values can be seen as parameters which are important for understanding the degradation of RNA molecules.\n",
    "* The 5 ground truths/targets also have corresponding vectors `reactivity_error`, `deg_error_pH10` etc., which are estimated experimental errors for the reactivity values. These could be ignored initially, but are likely useful for model performance if included in some relevant way.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that `test.json` includes both the Public Test and Private Test data. The two subsets have to be separated by looking at the `seq_length` variable, which should be `107` for Public Test and `130` for Private Test.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also note the signal to noise, and the SN filter (these are described further on the Kaggle challenge page). Possibly want to exculde the \"noisy\" samples. \n",
